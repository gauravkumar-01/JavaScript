First we should make a canvas and make a cell size in it.

After that we make an 2-d array which maintains the position of the snake.

A function which updates the position of snake...

clearInterval accepts an ID and stops/clear the interval tiem of that Id.

==============================================================================

Math.random function is used to generate the random number.
Multiplied by width-cellSize || height-cellSize size to get the starting point of food cell.

It is may be in decimal, so we round it, by dividing with cellSize, after that we will again multiply with cellsize.
