================================================= BASICS ===========================================================

JS me 0 based indexing hoti hai, jb hm out of index value dete hai to hame "undefined" as a output milega, error nhi milegi...
In JavaScript not require to define datatype of variables.

We can not define a variable multiple times in JS.
    Eg: let a = 10;
        a = "Gaurav"

    NOTE : We can change the value of any variable in such way. It is possible in JS.
        These type of languages are known as "Weekly Type Languages".

First statement me ek "a" name ki bucket banegi and ek bucket aur banegi kisme 10 store hoga.
    (a wali bucket 10 wali bucket ko point out kr rhi hogi..)

Second statement me a name ki bucket phle se bani hui hai, "Gaurav" name ki bucket banegi, and then
    (a wali bucket "Gaurav" wali bucket bucket ko point krne lagegi..)

NOTE : Hm JS me variable ka datatype define nhi kr skte, Jb pura code execute ho jayega tb pta chalega ki variable kis type ka hai..
This type of languages are known as "Dynamically Type Language".

IMPORTANT :
    If we declare a variable and did not assign any value, then what happens :
        --> A bucket will create with the variable_name and it will point to "undefined".
        --> If we assign value, then a bucket of value is also created and the variable_name will point to bucket of its data.
