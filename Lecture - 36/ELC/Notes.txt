When an event triggers, then it undergoes three phases...
    -> Event Capturing
    -> Event Target
    -> Event Bubbling

IMPORTANT : If I clicked the child then the event propagates from the top most level to target, and the hierarchy followed is known as Event Capturing.

When we click on child and event triggers then it follows the hierarchy... :
    HTML -> Body -> Grandp -> parent -> child,
    this is called Event Capturing...

    CAPTURING : Top-most level se target tk jana...

#   Default value of capture is false.
    
    --> false : In case of false, the callback function of eventlistener will execute in Bubbling Phase.

    --> true : In case of true, the callback function of eventlistener executes in capturing phase.

The final point where we have to reach, it is called target.
    Here, the target was "child".

Go back from target to top-most place, is called Event Bubbling..

==============================================================================

documnet.eventListener(type,listener(function),usecaptue){
    This is the code
}

UseCapture : It returns a boolean value & its default value is false.
    => Due to this default value the event is working in "BUBBLING" phase not in capturing phase.
    => To work the event in capturing phase, we should make the usecapture value is true.


NOTE : InOrder to stop the event for further propagation, we should use 'stopPropagation()'.
