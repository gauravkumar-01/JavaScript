Prototypes : 
    If we try to access the properties of the object then JS will firstly find it in that object and then if not found then it will go to its Prototype.

WHAT IS PROTOTYPE ??
        It is also an another object, which is used as a fallback source of properties.

Fallback Source : Jab hamara object kisi property ko batane me fail ho jata hai, tb vo prototype(Parent) ke pas jata hai, us object ki khoj mai. This is called FallBack.

.__proto__      // used to find the prototype/parent of any object..
todo.__proto__      ==> Output -> Object { â€¦ }
Object.prototype.__proto__   ==> Output -> null

.__proto__  => It directly access the prototype of variables.
.prototype.__proto__  => It is dender prototype, used when we access the prototype of variable's parent or above..


Note : JavaScript ke har object ke pas prototype hota hai..

"Everything inside JS is an Object."

    Array,String & Everything behind the scenes khud ko object me convert krta hai..
    It also stores the data in the form of key:value pair..
    key --> index       &&      value --> data

This whole process is called Inheritence.

Note : We can make temporary changes in the methods, but not supposed to do that...
