Constructor :

    'new' Keyword before the function calling, creates that function as a constructor.
    Constructor is use to create object.
    We can give the values/properties inside the constructor, using this keyword.

Constructor functions are used as the blueprint to create the similar type of objects.


We can add as many properties in our constructor as we want,


Convention : It is not compulsary to start name of constructor with capital letter, but it is suggested to start the constructor name with Capital Letter.
        It is used to genrate the object.
    
we can add some properties of our object in the self made prototype.


EXAMPLE :
hmne ek example me description ka alag se prototype banaya hai,
jb hum user.description krege to phle fun me jakr description check karega,jb fun me description nhi milega tb fun ke prototype me check hoga.
agr mil jayega to return kr dega, nhi to error through karega..
