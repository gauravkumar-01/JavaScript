PROMISES :

Promises are used to tackle the problem of Call-back Hell.

Syntax of Promises : new Promise();     //Promise is a reserve keyword.
Note : On using "new" Keyword an object is created.

new Promise accepts an function.
Promise accepts a function in its arguments

When we call the Promise then it is called by using two arguments.
                    => resolve -> first arguments
                    => reject -> second argument

jb data mil jayega, to resolve function
nhi milega to reject function...

resolve function ka kaam "then" keyword karega..

In real-world, Hm promise likhenge nhi, hum us par kaam karenge.......


//  .then chaining
There will be vetical a long chain of then, if we use resolve function again & again.

To avoid this chaining problem, we use async-await..

Note : CallBack Hell me code horizontally grow hota hai, and .then chaining me code vertically grow hota hai...
