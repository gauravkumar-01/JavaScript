To find the datatype we will use "typeof" attribute..

Number can store : +,-,Infinite, NaN

In General Equality :
    -> Typecasting Ocuurs.
    -> It checks only the content of left side of equality or right side of equality is equal or not.
    -> It does not check the datatype.

In Strict Equality :
    -> Typecasting does not occurs.
    -> It checks the content as well as the datatype of both side of equality.
    -> If both(content and datatype) will be same then it returns true otherwise returns false.


# UNDEFINED v/s NULL

    => Undefined : When we declares a variable and did not assign any value, then by default JS defined its value as 'undefined'.
    => Null : When we want to not assign any value to the variable then we will explicitly assign a value 'null' to it.

# Some Inportant to Know :
    -> 0/10 = 0, (It's type is Number.)
    -> 10/0 = Infinity, (It's type is Number.)
    -> 0/0 = NaN, (It's type is Number.)
    -> undefined, (It's type is 'undefined'.)
