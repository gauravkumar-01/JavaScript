/* *************** SCOPE = 'Aukat' ********************* */

Hoisting : When we access any variable/function before declaring it, this process is called Hoisting.
    Hoisting can be done in var variable easily.

let & const --> It has Block Scope..
    We can not access let variable before initialising it.

    IMPORTANT NOTE : Hoisting will occur in "let / const" variable only when there is Dead-Temporal Zone. 

    Dead-Temporal Zone : It is the phase between MCP and CEP.
                    Dead-Temporal Zone occurs only for let/const..
                    We can not access the variable, untill we will not assign its value..
                    Dead-Temporal zone occurs between MCP(Memory Creation Phase) and CEP(Code Execution Phase).
var --> It has functional scope...

NOTE : var ko access krne ke liye hm Parent's Lexical Environment me ja sakte hai..

SCOPE = Local memory + Lexical Environment of it's Parent
Lexical Environment = Local Memory + Parents Memory
