If we want to traverse the DOM tree :

METHOD 1 :
    ==> From Child to Parent :
        --> Select the child.
        --> child.parentElement.

METHOD 2 :
    ==> From Parent to Child :
        --> Select the Parent.
        --> parent.children => it returns the collection


To check next Element Sibling we can will use nextElementSibling

We can know about these three parts..
    --> Parent of any node
    --> Child of any node
    --> Sibling of any node.
