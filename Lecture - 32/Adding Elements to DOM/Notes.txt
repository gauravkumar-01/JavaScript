If we want to add any element in DOM then first we should have that element.

It can be done by using "createElement".

To adding or appending element we need to select parent of that element then we use "appendChild".

appendChild --> Accepts only one Element.

IMPORTANT NOTE : A child can have only one Parent.
Note : We can add more then one Element at a time by using "append" method.

    append : It will add all the elements (that are given inside it) at the last.


If we want to add elements at the starting then we use "prepend".
==> prepend() : It will add elements at Starting.
                It can accept multiple arguments.
