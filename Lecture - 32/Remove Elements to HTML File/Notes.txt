To remove any element we should have access of it's parent.

--> First, We should access of the parent.
--> Second, We access the child which we want to remove.


Note : We have only two methods to remove the elements are :
    --> removeChild() : It remove only one child(first occurance) of the parent.

    --> remove() : It removes all the occurances of child.

=======================================

To remove the particular element we dont neet to select the parent.

Example :
    let id3 = document.querrySelector('#id3);       // The tag which has id of id3 will get selected in id3.

    // To remove it, we simply use -
        id3.remove();
