Advantages of Call-Back Nesting :
    --> Each function will run in sequential manner

Disadvantages of Call-back Nesting :
    --> It grows horizontally. This is called Call-Back DOOM or Call-back Hell.
    --> Due to horizontal growth, readiability becomes very worst..
    --> There is dependancy of next step on previous step.


IMPORTANT :
    --> To avoid this type of Call-back hell we use Promises.
    --> To avoid Promises we use Async- Await.
