We can store the entire function inside the variable in JavaScript.

Whenever we store the entire function in any variable then it is known as :
    --> Functional Expression
    --> First Class Function
    --> First Class Citizen


We can define our variable by using :
    --> var
    --> let
    --> const

Whenever a JavaScript code is run then a Global Execution Context is created.
It has 2 main phases :
    --> MCP : Memory Creation Phase
        Before Executing the code the memory is allocated to all variables and functions.

        Before the exection of code undefined is point by each variables, value will assigned while execution of code.

    --> CEP : Code Execution Phase
        After allocation of memory the code will execute line by line.

Note : When any function is run then a new execution context is created.
    ==> After the execution of code, the execution contest will destroy.
    ==> These all execution context will run in call stack.
    ==> After executtion of context it will destroy from call stack.
    ==> Call Stack will continue till it not becomes empty.
