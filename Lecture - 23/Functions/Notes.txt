Functions are heart of JavaScript.

It is a program, that done any particular work when it calls.

Some Terminologies of Functions : 
    --> Function Declaration -> by using 'function' keyword.
    --> Function Calling -> by using the name of the function.
    --> Parameterised Function -> Values are catched as a parameter inside the function. The values are passed at time of function calling are called arguments.
        -> Default Parameterised Function : When default value is set to the parameters.
    --> Functional Expression : Storing function into a variable.
        Functional Expressions are also known as -
            -> 1st class Function
            -> 1st class citizen
    --> Anonymous Function
    --> Higher Order Function
    --> Call Back Functions

Notes : We can call functions as many times as we want.

Function is declared by a keyword "function".
Function always return sumething, if nothing is returned then it return "undefined">

return mtlb jha se function ko call kiya gya hai, vha function ki returned value send kr do..

If we will not pass any value in Default Parameterised function then it will point default value, else it will point the argumented value.
