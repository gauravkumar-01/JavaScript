Classes are added after EcmaScript 6.
Before classes, constructor was used.

Note : There is no difference between the functionality of class and constructor.

Syntantical Sugar : A better way of writing the beautiful Syntax.

Constructor are called by using "new" keyword.

Class Syntax : we use a keyword "class".
            We use a keyword constructor inside class.

Note : We can inherit any class using "extend" keyword.
        If we want to add any new property to new class then we will override the constructor.

        Previous properties are used using "super constructor" by using "super" keyword.

        If we define the same function in the new class, then it will run not the function of Parent class will run.
