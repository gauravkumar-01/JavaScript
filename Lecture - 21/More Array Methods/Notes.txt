Some More Array Methods :

    --> slice() : It returns the values from the starting index to end index.
                => End index will not include..
                => No change will occurs in original array.

    --> splice() : It makes changes in original array.
                => It deletes and returns the values from the array.
                => It includes the end index.
                => If we add more arguments to slice (except the starting and ending index) then these values will add in the array from the starting index as given in arguments.

    --> split() : It is only for string.
                => We can split the string from particular character.
                => It will return an array of seperated words.

    --> join() : It is used to join or merge the values with particular character.
                => It can be used in array or string.

    --> concat() : It is for both strings and for arrays.
                    => It merge the two strings or arrays into single string or array.

    --> includes() : It returns the boolean values, for both string and array.
                    => It works in array as well as in Strings.
                    => It check wether the given value is present in the array at any index or not.
                    => In String it will check weather the substring present inside it or not.

            NOTE : If present then it return the true else returns false.

    --> indexOf() : It returns the index of value in array if present, else returns -1.
                => It is valid for both Strings and Array.
                => We can pass substring as an argument to find index.

    --> reverse() : It reverses the values of the array.
                => It does not work on string.
                => It make changes in original array.


NOTE : Arrays are bydefault reference type.
It means change in one array will reflect in another Array.
