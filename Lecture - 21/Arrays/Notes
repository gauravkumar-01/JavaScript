ARRAYS :
    -> DataStructure
    -> Ordered Data DataStructure(Preserves the input order.)
    -> Hetrogeneous Types(may contains different datatypes.)

Note : In JS we not need to define the datatype of Array.
    => Everything inside JS is an Object.

IMPORTANT :
    -> There can be nesting of Array in JavaScript.
    -> We can use any datatype in array.


==> ARRAYS METHODS :
    There are two types of Array :
        -> Destructive :
            If we done any changes in array, then all the changes will reflect in the original array.
        
        -> Non-Destructive :
            If we do changes in the array then these changes will occur in particular array only. No change will occur in original Array.

==============================================================================

==> Some Methods in Array :
    -> push() : used to add the value at the last of the array.
    -> pop() : last available element will be poped out of the array.
        When our array is empty then, it will return undefined.
    -> unshift() : It will add the value at the starting of the array & returns the length of the array.
    -> shift () : It removes the first value of the array & return it.


IMPORTANT NOTE : pop() & shift() : returns the removed elements from the array.
    push() & unshift() : add the elements and return the length of the array.
