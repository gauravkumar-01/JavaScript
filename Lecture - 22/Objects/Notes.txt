What is Object ?
    --> It is a unordered data-structure.
    --> collection of properties.

Properties : It is a pair of key and value.

Objects are the data-structure,unlike array.
    It is unordered in nature.


Syntax of Object :
    let object_name = {key,value pairs};

    Note : Each pair is separated by comma(,) and key values are separated by colon (:).

Note : Key and Values are seperated by colon (:).

We can access each key by using dot(.) operator.


WHY DO WE MAKE OBJECTS ??
    We will make object to store multiple task of the particular value.

All the keys in memory bydefault stores as the String.
Objects are also pass by reference in JavaScript.

Note : We can define function inside objects.
**Important** : Those functions which are defined inside objects are known as Methods.


    EVERYTHING INSIDE JAVASCRIPT IS AN OBJECT.
