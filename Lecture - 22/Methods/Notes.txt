We can store the function inside object.
Those functions are defined inside objects are known as Methods.

Method always returns a vlaue.
When we do not return anything from the function, then JavaScript return "undefined" automatically.

Note : We can access all properties of our object using "this" keyword.
    If we write "this" keyword inside any method then it will point the particular object.
