DOM Events with Mouse .

SOME MOUSE EVENTS ARE :
    --> mouseenter Events
    --> mouseleave Events
    --> onclick Events

Note : If we want to run multiple function with single event then it can not be done simply, we will use "event listener".

addEventListener : It accepts two arguments('name of the event' , function);
