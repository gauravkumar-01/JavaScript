Some Properties of  HTML :

    --> innerText : Ye kisi tag ke andr jo text present hoga vo dega (multiple spaces ko neglect kr dega..).
                    It know about CSS.

    --> Text content : It gives the text same as present inside the element.
                    It does not know about CSS.

    --> Inner HTML : It will return each & everything
                    It may be text, styling, element, content etc..
                    return text + tags(information / attribute)

Note : These three properties are act as getters and setters.

By using the Properties we can get data.
But by using these 3 above properties we can also set data.
            Most Suitable : innerHTML.


We have some attribute(additional information) in JS foe setters.
