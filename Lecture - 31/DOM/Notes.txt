DOM : Document Object Model

It is used to make changes in the html file, by using some selectors.

SELECTORS :
    => get elements by TagName : Select all the elements of the particular tagname.
                                It returns an array of all the particular elements.
    => get elements by ID : It select the only one element of Particular Id.
                                If we have multiple id of same name, then it will return the first element to whom Id is given.
    => get elements by Classname : It selects the multiple elements of same class name.
                                    It will return the array of all the elements of same class name.

                                Note : It is not a regular array, we can not use push/pop operations in these array.
    => Querry selectors :
                            It is used to select multiple elements at a time.
                            --> Hm log id ko select krne ke liye "getElementbyId"
                            --> Class ko select krne ke liye "getElementsByclass"
                            --> tag ko select krne ke liye "getElementsByTagname" use krte hai..

                            To is tarike ke multiple task se bachne ke liye, hm Querry Selectors ka use kr skte hai...

            Note : We can select elements(by name),class(by dot),Id(by #) by using Querry Selector.
                    It will return only one element( First hitting Element).


    => Querry Selector All : It is same as Querry Selector but it returns all the elements in the "NodeList".
                                NodeList => It is a type of Array.
                            If we have given same "Id" to multiple elements then it will return all the elements.


Note : To access any HTML file, we use document and see it in Inspector after Inspecting it.
    To select any element, we use dot(.).
    The tag which we want to select in JS file, we will write it inside String.


After selecting any element by tagname, it will select all the elements of that tag name.
After selectiong elements, if want to change its styling then we use ".style" & any property we want to give will be given by using dot(.).
    Format : element.style.property
    Example : p.style.color = 'red';        // Here color of p tag will become red.
